## What is HPC

::: {.theme-section}

> HPC, known as supercomputing, is really nothing less than the ability to process complex (computational) tasks at very high speed.  The machine you use to do this is called a Supercomputer. (EuroCC Netherlands)

In the context of this HPC Spring school we use a simpler and broader definition:

> Any system that provides computational power beyond your own computer. This can be a single (remote) machine, a cluster of machines, or a cloud platform.
